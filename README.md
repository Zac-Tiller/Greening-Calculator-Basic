# Greening-Calculator-Basic
My first attempt at a tool to help with sports betting. It provides the user the ability to evaluate the risk reward of any hedges (greening up or redding) which they may wish to do in trading the sports exchanges in real-time

Future improvemets will be:
- Turning the command line interface into a GUI
- Creating graphs to show the evolution of the risk/return with the changing odds
- Connecting to an exchange API to pull live odds data, and possibly to give the user the chance to execute a trade
